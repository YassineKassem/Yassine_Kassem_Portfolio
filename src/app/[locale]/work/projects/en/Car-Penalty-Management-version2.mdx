## Overview

This project is the continuation and enhancement of the **Car Penalty Management System**, originally developed as an academic project and later transformed into a professional solution in collaboration with Swiss Premium Negoce (SPN). Initially conceived during a data science course at ESPRIT, it evolved into an AI-driven application validated by ESPRIT and showcased at the "Bal du Projet." This version incorporates advanced features and methodologies for real-world deployment.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning-Based Document Segmentation**: Transitioned from traditional preprocessing to models like MobileNetV3-Large and ResNet-50 for precise document segmentation, improving efficiency and accuracy.
- **Noise Reduction with Denoising Autoencoders**: Enhanced OCR accuracy by applying autoencoders for cleaning noisy document images, reducing artifacts like shadows and folds.
- **Automated Text Extraction and Analysis**: Utilized OCR Space API for text recognition and integrated large language models (LLMs) like Mistral-7B for structured data extraction.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning Models**: MobileNetV3-Large, ResNet-50, and Mistral-7B.
- **Image Processing**: Denoising autoencoders, Canny edge detection, and perspective transformation.
- **OCR Tools**: OCR Space API for text extraction.
- **Programming and Libraries**: Next.js 14, FastAPI, MongoDB, Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Computer Vision.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Manual Processes**: Transitioning from error-prone manual workflows to an automated system improved efficiency and minimized errors.
- **Segmentation Complexity**: Testing multiple models ensured accurate handling of diverse document layouts and noisy images.
- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tuning Mistral-7B on real-world datasets enabled precise extraction of penalty details, overcoming challenges posed by unstructured formats.

## Outcome

The solution reduced processing times significantly while enhancing accuracy in extracting and analyzing penalty information. With automation, SPN achieved greater scalability and reliability in managing violations, showcasing the power of AI-driven solutions in operational workflows.
