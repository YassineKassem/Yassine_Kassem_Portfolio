## Challenges and Learnings

Handling complex document layouts and inconsistent text orientations posed significant difficulties during the development process. Traditional preprocessing methods struggled to adapt to various document structures, which led to inefficiencies and inaccuracies in extracting relevant information. Additionally, ensuring high accuracy in OCR-based data extraction across diverse document formats required addressing issues like varying image qualities, text orientations, and noise levels. Region detection also presented challenges, as image transformations, such as scaling or rotation, often resulted in unstable keypoints and misaligned bounding boxes, reducing the reliability of existing methods.

## Outcome

The solution achieved significant efficiency gains by automating key processes, including data extraction and matching, drastically reducing the manual effort required. Improved document segmentation and text recognition accuracy minimized errors, ensuring reliable extraction of critical details from diverse document formats. The development of an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard empowered SPN administrators with real-time analytics, facilitating better and faster decision-making. Furthermore, the system demonstrated scalability by accommodating a wide range of document types and regional requirements, making it a versatile tool for managing penalties effectively.
